## Goal

Implement the "example" component which given the following usage:

``` html
<example :tags="['h1', 'h2', 'h3']"></example>
```

which renders the expected output:

``` html
<div>
  <h1>0</h1>
  <h2>1</h2>
  <h3>2</h3>
</div>
```

You should be using render functions, obviously. 

The detailed usage can be found in the 
[Vue Docs - render functions](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html#createElement-Arguments).
