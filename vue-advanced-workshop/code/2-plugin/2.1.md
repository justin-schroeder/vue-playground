# 2.1 Simple Plugin

## Goal

Create a plugin that teaches Vue components to handle a custom "rules"
option. The "rules" option expects an object that specifies validation rules
for data in the component.

Expected usage:

``` js
const vm = new Vue({
  data: { foo: 10 },
  rules: {
    foo: {
      validate: value => value > 1,
      message: 'foo must be greater than one'
    }
  }
})

vm.foo = 0 // should log: "foo must be greater than one"
```

## Hints

1. The plugin should install a global mixin
2. The global mixin contains a "created" hook
3. In the hook, check for `this.$options.rules`
