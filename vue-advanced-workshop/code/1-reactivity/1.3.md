# 1.3 Mini Observer

## Goal

Combine the previous two functions, renaming `convert()` to `observe()` and keeping `autorun()`:

- `observe()` converts the properties in the received object and make them
  reactive. For each converted property, it gets assigned a `Dep` instance which keeps track of a list of subscribing update functions, and triggers them to re-run when its setter is invoked.

- `autorun()` takes an update function and re-runs it when properties that the
  update function subscribes to have been mutated. An update function is said
  to be "subscribing" to a property if it relies on that property during its
  evaluation.

They should support the following usage:

``` js
const state = {
  count: 0
}

observe(state)

autorun(() => {
  console.log(state.count)
})
// should immediately log "count is: 0"

state.count++
// should log "count is: 1"
```

To test if your implementation is correct, run:

``` bash
npm test -- 1.3
```
