## 02-01 Introducing Writing Plugins
[Introducing Writing Plugins Video](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-vue/introducing-writing-plugins/)
* [Vue Docs - Plugins](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/plugins.html)
* [Vue Docs - Global Mixin](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/mixins.html#Global-Mixin)
* [Vue Docs - vm.$options](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#vm-options)

```javascript
function (Vue, options) {
  // â€¦ plugin code
}
```

`Vue.mixin(options)`

* if you want to apply global functionality to your vue app, you 
  would use mixins.
* plugins are deduped. 
  * always wrap mixins in a plugin, that's a best practice

* `this.$options` is on every component and contains merged options
  * contains custom options you have added to the component, too
