# Application Testing in Vue.js
By ALEX KYRIAKIDIS

_Learn all there is to know about unit testing Vue.js applications. 
We start with essentials topics, like what unit testing is, what 
features/code you should write tests for, and the fundamentals of the 
testing framework developed by Facebook, called Jest. This workshop also 
covers advanced topics, like integrating the official vue-test-utils library, 
testing vue.js component features, DOM integration, testing VueX, 
snapshot testing, mocks & stubs, and many more._
