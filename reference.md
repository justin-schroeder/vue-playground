## Vue Animations

### Vue Animations - Transition Classes
These are applied to elements undergoing transitions with the `<transitions>` component.
`v-enter`, `v-enter-active`, `v-enter-to`, `v-leave`, `v-leave-active`, `v-leave-to`

* See [Transitions > Transition Classes in the vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Transition-Classes)
* See Sarah Drasner's ball bouncing example in [06-02 CSS Animation ex2 - bouncing ball - excerpts](06_animations.md#06-02-css-animation-ex2---bouncing-ball---excerpts)

### Vue Animations - Transition Modes
This is for a common problem where thing A is fading out where thing B is fading in.
There are two modes, `in-out`, and `out-in`; you'll almost always use `out-in`, where an thing A goes away before thing A comes in.
